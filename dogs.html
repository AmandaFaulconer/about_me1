		 Rincon is older. I rescued him six years ago from a puppy mill. He is around 13 years old now. For his birthday, I go off of his adoption date, which is July 5th. He is getting older now, so he is a bit slower. He can’t jump onto the couch anymore. He only has about half of his teeth so he can’t eat totally food. He absolutely loves clothes. He has a huge wardrobe, filled with mostly sweaters and fluffy jackets. He is also a big snuggler. He gets under a blanket any chance he gets.

		Paco is my youngest Chihuahua. He is seven years old. His birthday is May 26th. He is supposed to be a pure bread long haired chihuahua, but I don’t think that is true. He looks like he is a medium hair chihuahua mixed with papillon. He is not the smartest dog. He has a very short attention span and lives each day like it’s a new day. I have to reteach him commands all the time. He is also very independent. He likes to hang on his own on his bed. He only snuggles when its time to go to bed.
